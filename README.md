Keep the grid from going Offline.

My entry for Js13KGames 2018.

# How to play
1. Deliver as many kWH of power as possible.
1. The more power being consumed, the faster your score will increase.
1. Generation and consumption vary with the weather and time of day.
1. Keep an eye on the clock and weather forecast.
1. Toggle buildings on and offline, to manage consumption.
1. Don't let consumption exceed generation or the grid will go offline and the game will end.
